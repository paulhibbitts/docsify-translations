## docsify multilanguage translations

With the release of Docsify v5 it was identified that this available language translation was no longer up-to-date and correct, so it has been temporarily removed. 

It is recommended that Brower language translation be used with the [English version of the Docsify.js.org documentation](https://docsify.js.org/#/?id=docsify) in order to provide up-to-date and correct documentation in multiple languages.

For additional information about using popular Browsers for language translation, please refer to the following links:

- [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/website-translation)
